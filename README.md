# Portfolio
All files in this portfolio are originally programmed by me. They may contain some tutorial boilerplate that I was working off. In those cases, I will specify what is boilerplate and what is original work.
Some of my work may contain profanity because I decided to create some methods and variables during times when I was extremely frusterated and I did not have a ducky to talk with. 

## Arduino
While I have done many projects in arduino, few of them I would say are even remotely neat enough to actually be considered. 
### timelapse.ino
~ Fall 2021
Is a project that I was working on for the Wonder Chamber. This is the arduino firmware that is connected with its javascript variant (also included in the 'JavaScript' folder). It takes signals from joysticks, buttons, and rotory encoders and encapsulates in an ad-hoc serial protocol I created to send those signals to a javascript application. 

## C++
### Xenon2
~ Spring 2022
Is an attempt to build a game engine from scratch using Vulkan. Some of its features are
- Custom filesystem built from scratch
- Uses the v8 scripting engine to create scriptable components
- Easily modify, add, or remove shaders

### Brain Visualizer
~ Fall 2021
Is another project for the Wonder Chamber. In this project, I took a csv of recorded neural activity and wanted to visualize different algorithms applied to that neural activity. Some of the things I was able to create using this project as a stepping stone was a live visualizer of neural activity. 

## C#
C# is my language of choice and where my programming skills are the *most* strong in. 

### Novovu.Argon
~ Fall 2019
Is a UI design system I built because I was frusterated using winforms in my c# applications and I wanted to be able to write my user interfaces in html. This application uses CEF and has its own custom component system akin to what you would see in the numerous amount of javascript frameworks.

### Novovu.Xenon
~ Spring 2020
Is a MonoGame based game engine utilizing MicrosoftClearscript's Javascript engine. Most of the shader code in the final renderer is not mine. 

### NovovuWorkshopG3
~ Spring 2020
Is a UI for my game engine built in Avalonia. I had to create a custom component for it to view the engine's output and to manipulate the engine. I also created a library of custom UI controls including:
- Radial Context Menu
- Keyframe Editor
- Node Editor
- EQ Editor

### Peridot
~ Spring 2019
Is my attempt at a C# based webserver because for some applications I wanted to embed a webserver in them for management. Some of its features are
- Custom login/protected endpoints system. 
- Backend C# plugins. 
- Custom routing specified by the implementing application. 

### Project Emergency Framework
~ Current
Is a FiveM (GTA5 Roleplay) server that I have been working on for the past year. It has been my most recent passion project. 

## JavaScript
I use JavaScript whenever I am doing any project that requires the use of any web technologies. 

### RoTools
~ Spring 2021
Is a project I made to serve as an administration panel for ROBLOX games. I was going to attempt to commercialize it, however I ultimately decided against it due to server expenses exceeding profitability on what the average consumer would actually spend. I created both the panel system and a dynamic orchestration system, built off kubernetes, which allowed me to create a new instance whenever someone asked. 

### Timelapse
~ Fall 2021
JavaScript frontend for the timelapse project mentioned earlier. 

## Python
If I had a choice in using any language - I would not use Python. The only times I have ever really used python are when the project is not otherwise achievable with any other language. 

### Controller
~ Fall 2021
Is a Python application written on a distributed set of raspberry Pis to control a 22x22 matrix of lightbulbs for the Wonder Chamber. It takes an input from a depth sensor to detect where a person is standing, and then lights up the bulb based on the depthmap, thus allowing to be a "reverse silhouette."

### IonProblem3
~ Spring 2022
Is a jupyter notebook I was working on when I was attempting to get into quantum computing research.
